# LazyMailer


This tool was made just to reduce my pain to send emails. Was bored copying and pasting and hitting alt+tab continuously!! 

This tool was develepoed in Linux environment. It does work with windows too but there are some file permission issues that I encountered.
Didn't care to find a solution sorry as the tool is already serving its purpose for me UwU.

Few tips if you plan on using gmail as sender account(as I did):

Your normal gmail password will not work with the tool.
Google has discontinued the use of Less Secure Apps and instead you'll have to use an APP PASSWORD for this case
Go to your gmail account settings > enable 2FA > generate a new APP password for using this less secure app 
PS: If you are saving the password in a file, do encrypt it!! You can use "vim -x" option to encrypt it. (On Linux)

Enjoy!!
